# Repo for Market Price Prediction Algorithm Development

## Dev environment setup:
- Python version used: 3.10.5
- Recommend virtual environment setup following instructions here:

## Current State:
- Two simple SVR algorithms and a moving average strategy; the SVRs use the `sklearn` module as the ML backbone
- The repo primarily leverages the python `backtrader`, `yfinance`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` modules for raw data, formatting, and visualization

## Future:
- Develop an algorithm that approaches the ~70% win rate described in the research below
- Get freaky
